/*
The Ackermann function is a classic example of a recursive function, notable especially because it is not a primitive recursive function. It grows very quickly in value, as does the size of its call tree.

The Ackermann function is usually defined as follows:

A(m,n)=⎧⎩⎨⎪⎪n+1A(m−1,1)A(m−1,A(m,n−1))if m=0if m>0 and n=0if m>0 and n>0. 
Its arguments are never negative and it always terminates.

Write a function which returns the value of  A(m,n) . Arbitrary precision is preferred (since the function grows so quickly), but not required. */

const ack = (m, n) => {
    if (m === 0) return n + 1
    if (m > 0 && n === 0) return ack(m - 1, 1)
    return ack(m - 1, ack(m, n - 1))
}
